        "bio": "I am a Full-Stack web developer with over ten years of experience in primary and secondary education. Recently, I completed a full stack development program form the University of Richmond, and am up to date on the newest trends in JavaScript, MERN, and responsive web design. As an educator, I also pride myself on giving dynamic, engaging, presentations that effectively communicate technical concepts to a variety of audiences. My latest project was a PWA for summer camp staff in locations that lack ideal mobile connectivity. I am eager to use my experience as a teacher and my passion for programming to make your business more appealing to our user.",
